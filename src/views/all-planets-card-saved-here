                    <v-card-text>“The closest planet to the sun that orbits the sun within only 87.9 earth days, should be the hottest planet in the whole solar system”, one would think. Even though this is not entirely true, one would not be mistaken for thinking that way. Mercury has the most ironic temperature rage in the whole solar system. Since the planet virtually has no atmosphere, it makes it difficult for the sun to travel from the daylight side to the night side. This means that one half of the planet is always extremely hot at +430 degree C, while the other is so cold at -180 degree C. So to live on this planet, you would either burn or freeze to death instantly.</v-card-text>

This planet is always referred to as the giant planet, due to its amazing size. Jupiter is almost made of gas with almost 75% hydrogen, and 24% helium. Its core is presumed rocky hard, while surrounded with a sea with metallic liquid.</v-card-text>
